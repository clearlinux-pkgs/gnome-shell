Subject: [PATCH 143/152] environment: Try harder to find a transition

When easing, we need the transition of one of the involved properties
to connect our callbacks. Currently we simply get the transition for
the first property, however as Clutter optimizes the case where a
property doesn't actually change, that transition may be NULL even
though we still animate other properties.

So instead of only looking at the transition of the first property,
try to find a transition for any of the involved properties.
